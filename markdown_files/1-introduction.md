  * HTML is not a programming language. It is classified as markup language.
  * Being used for describing the structure of any Web page.
  * HTML does this via elements. These elements tell the browser how to display the content given in these elements.
  * HTML marks content for web browsers. Such as "this is a paragraph", "this is an image", "this is a link", etc.

### Simple HTML Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>This is a title</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

</html> 
```

* We will discuss these elements in more detail on next documents. First, let's discuss about what is an element.

# HTML Elements
  * As we said earlier, HTML works with elements. These elements tell the browser how to display the content given in these elements.
  * An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
  ```
  <tagname>Content</tagname>
  ```
