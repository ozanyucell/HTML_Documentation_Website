# HTML Comments
 * You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
  ```
  <!-- Comments here -->
  ```
#
  * HTML comments, as every other comment method, hide HTML code too.
  ```
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
  ```
  * Second won't be displayed.

  * Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
  ```
  <p>This <!-- hidden text --> is a paragraph.</p> 
  ```
  * Hidden text part won't be displayed.
