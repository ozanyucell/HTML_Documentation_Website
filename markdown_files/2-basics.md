# HTML Basics
  * All HTML documents must contain ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` at the beginning of the file.This is called **document type declaration**.
  * The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
  * The HTML document begins with ```<html>``` tag and ends with ```</html>``` tag.
  
  ### Headings
  * HTML headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags. ```<h1>``` defines the most important heading. ```<h6>``` defines the least important heading.
  ```
  <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
  <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
  <h3>This is heading 3</h3> 
  ```

  ### Paragraphs
  * HTML paragraphs are defined with the ```<p>``` tag.
  ```
  <p>This is paragraph 1.</p>
  <p>This is paragraph 2.</p> 
  ```

  ### Links
  * HTML links are defined with the ```<a>``` tag.
  ```
   <a href="https://ce.ieu.edu.tr/en">Click here to go my university's website.</a> 
  ```
  * The link's destination is specified in the ```href``` attribute. 


  ### Images
  * HTML images are defined with the ```<img>``` tag.
  ```
  <img src="ozanyucel.jpg" alt="github.com/ozanyucell" width="104px" height="142px"> 
  ```
  * The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
  * ```px``` is basically pixels.
